Engula is a storage engine that empowers engineers to build reliable and cost-effective databases with less effort and more confidence.

Engula's design goals are as follows:

- Elastic: unbundles components to leverage elastic resources on the cloud
- Adaptive: optimizes its own data structures according to dynamic workloads
- Extensible: provides flexible APIs and modules to program application logic
- Platform independent: supports flexible deployments on local hosts, on-premise servers, and cloud platforms

Engula is in the demo stage now.
Please check **[the roadmap](https://github.com/engula/engula/issues/1)** for more details.
